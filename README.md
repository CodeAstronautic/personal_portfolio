Hi! I'm Sophia. I'm a full-stack software developer based in NYC.

I'm comfortable throughout the stack, but my passion lies in the front end, at the intersection of code and design. I currently build software for the newsroom at the New York Times.

Previously, I've taught code to women at the Grace Hopper Program, served in the Peace Corps, and management consulted for Fortune 100 companies. I also hold a degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania.

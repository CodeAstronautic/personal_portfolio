          ​Outside of code, I like to create in other ways. From <a href="https://medium.com/mpooja_15" target="_blank">blogging</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChfrVcFHC-mfoqrJHuOYt-Q" target="_blank">music-making</a>, <a href="http://sophiacioccaphotography.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">photography</a> to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sidewalk_poetry/" target="_blank">guerilla sidewalk chalk street art</a>, I'm always trying new ways of expressing myself. I also like to meditate, talk to strangers, and run lifestyle experiments.
